# Parallax Website
## Overview
The Parallax Website is a dynamic web project designed to utilize parallax scrolling effects to create an immersive user experience. As the user scrolls down the page, various elements move at different speeds, creating a sense of depth and engagement.

Mountain Background: The background image of mountains remains fixed as the user scrolls, providing a sense of stability and depth to the scene.

Adventure Title and Man: The title "Adventure" and an illustrated man in the foreground move upwards at different speeds as the user scrolls down the page. The title moves faster than the man, creating a visually interesting effect.

Adventure Sport Sections: Each adventure sport section features fixed imagery while the accompanying text moves upwards at a slower speed as the user scrolls. This effect adds dynamism and interest to the content, enhancing the overall visual appeal of the website.
